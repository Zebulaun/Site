    <p>
      Hello, I'm a Roblox Studio scripter. I'm still in school, so expect wacky schedules and delays. I'm experienced enough to make:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Basic Simulator games (uses DataStore2)
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-saving tycoon games
        </li>
        <li>
          Obbies (checkpoints, kill-parts, gps, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      Here's a game I made all by myself:
      </br>
      <a href='https://www.roblox.com/games/5606148116/Eating-Simulator-X?refPageId=c85836cd-a878-4ecb-ab90-9935a944be0f#!/game-instances'>Eating Simulator X</a>
      </br>
      </br>
      Prices are 1000R$ for a simulator, 750R$ for a tycoon, and only 100R$ for an obby. Pay through shirts.
      </br>
      By dealing with me, you must have 1) enough money to pay for what you want and 2) thoughtfulness about me being busy with school.
